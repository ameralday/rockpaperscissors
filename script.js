    create a button that activates the function

    create a random number generator and multiply it by 100 before rounding down so that it returns a whole number (math.floor)

    Have it return the string "rock" when the number is <3 (that will give 3 chances: 0,1,2)

    Have it return the string "paper" when the number is >=3 but also <6 so that it will give 3 chances (3,4,5)

    Have it return the string "scissors" when the number is <9 (also 3 chances: 6,7,8)

    console.log the result
